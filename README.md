# WebKeyz_ToDoList

Build a fully material To-Do app which help user to view his tasks, add, remove and edit.
General project requirements 
 
•	Minimum API version 21.
•	Use Navigation component
•	Use MDC components
•	Use MVVM pattern
•	Use Dagger 2 , RxJava  and Data binding
•	Cache user tasks (online /offline)
•	Use sandbox site to mock 4 web services (getTasks , add , edit , remove)
•	Show loading indicator whenever there is a network request, hide when done.
•	Error handling: (Create custom Rx retrofit Adapter which help you to override RX Retrofit adapter call back onError() and return (code /message) instead of Expectation).

o	No internet connection: show full dialog include message “No Internet connection” with retry button.
o	Show toast message in case of api error (meaningful message)

•	Build base layer which handle network errors, loading indicator across app screens so that not duplicate your code.


Base layer Guidelines:

•	Build base fragment to handle error and loading UI.
•	Build base view model to emit loading flag, errors message to base fragment via LiveData.
•	Build base Observer which hold view model reference and override onSubscribe() to show loading indicator , override onNext() to hide loading indicator , and override onError() to hide loading indicator and pass error message.


Screen 1: 

Task will have 
o	Name
o	Date / time
o	Status (initial / finished)

If tasks is empty show in the center of screen (Icon / text) to inform user that there is no tasks

The application displays a list of tasks (name/ date and time / icon with first letter of task) with Fab button to add new task

When long click on task show 2 toolbar actions (remove/finish tasks)
•	Remove will remove task and update list, show confirmation dialog first.
•	Finish will update task status.

Screen 2: Add task

Add name (use microphone also) and date/time dialogs.

Screen 3: Edit task

User can edit name / date and time, or set flag that task is finished.



Regarding to sandbox , you can save tasks list, add/edit/remove from this list, you can response with api error to see how your app will response.. Please read:
